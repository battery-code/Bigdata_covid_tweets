# Exploratory Notebooks  

This folder contains raw, unstructured Jupyter notebooks where the core analysis was performed. 
These notebooks represent the initial exploration, data processing, and visualization steps that ultimately contributed to the final insights presented in the main notebook and PowerPoint summary.  

## About These Notebooks  
- They contain **key visualizations** that were used in the final presentation.  
- They document the **approach taken to arrive at inferences**, showing intermediate steps and thought processes.  
- The code is largely **unstructured and uncommented**, as these were used for rapid iteration and testing different hypotheses.  
- Some notebooks may include **alternative modeling approaches** or analysis that were later refined in the final report.  

## Purpose  
While these notebooks are not meant for direct execution, they provide valuable insight into the process behind the final analysis. 
They demonstrate the depth of work, effort, and experimentation that went into the project.  

For a structured and polished version of the analysis, please refer to the main Jupyter notebook in the root directory.
